# react-users

A simple exercise that displays users in a list, with individual pages shown through the power of react router. 
Fire it up bu running `npm install` and then running `npm start`.

Technologies used:
- Webpack
- React(16)
- React Router 4
- StyledJSX

Currently no Redux in place, but since the API interaction logic is seperated into containers and the components are kept 'pure', it should be an easy implementation.

Tests are ran with `npm run test`, `npm run test:watch` and the coverage can be displayed by `npm run test:coverage`
